Practising HTML while creating a recipes webpage.

Current lesson: PROJECT: RECIPES

On this project I'm testing my skills I've learned previous 3 days while reading The Odin Project "Foundations" course.

Expectations: Adding and commiting files on my local computer while easily writing code for the webpage and finally pushing it all onto the GitHub repository.

Reality: It took me some time, wasn't as easy as i thought it would be, but it was still kind of easy. I'm very proud of my first project doing The Odin Project.
